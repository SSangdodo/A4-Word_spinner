House of Ashes' plot is set in the former territory of the Akkadian Empire, which existed in Mesopotamia around 4,000 years ago. In the game's timeline, it was the site of the crash-landing of a spaceship that carried thousands of large, bat-like aliens, which were controlled by a parasite that gestates within the host's body. The disease caused the aliens to mutate into vampires vulnerable to ultraviolet light; they had been hibernating underground for millennia, occasionally venturing to the surface to feed on their victims' adrenaline. The prologue takes place in 2231 BC, as a Gutian army prepares to invade the capital Akkad and a solar eclipse allows the vampires beneath the temple to emerge and massacre both armies. Following the prologue, the game cuts to a library owned by the Curator, who introduces himself to the player and provides information about parts of House of Ashes' gameplay, including the decision-making system and the pictures system.
