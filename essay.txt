The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is an interactive drama and survival horror game[1][2] presented from a third-person perspective.[3] Player control switches between five protagonists, working for the armed forces of their respective countries during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, who become trapped in an underground ancient Akkadian temple infested by vampiric creatures.[4] Managing the characters' relationships is one of the game's core mechanics; they can be amicable, being courageous and ensuring everyone survives despite their differences, or they can continue alone and be concerned with their personal safety instead.[5][6] Characters often quote the proverb "the enemy of my enemy is my friend", one of the story's recurring themes.[7]

House of Ashes is the first game in The Dark Pictures Anthology to feature difficulty levels, which affect the game's quick time events (QTEs), another core gameplay feature. Players are given the option to hold rather than mash buttons, and they can give themselves more time to respond to the prompts.[1] Several scenes, including combat-heavy ones, make use of QTEs that can lead to penalties like a protagonist's death if an input is not precisely timed.[7] The game displays a notice whenever a QTE is about to happen, illustrating the type of action the QTE is intended to perform.[8] Some types of QTEs involve pressing specific buttons to trigger actions from the player character, such as dodging an obstacle[7] or keeping calm when hiding from a threat.[9][10] Another type involves moving a reticle onto a target to shoot it.[11]
